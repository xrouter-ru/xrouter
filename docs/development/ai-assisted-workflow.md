# AI-Assisted Development Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the development workflow using AI assistance (Cline) along with code quality tools and testing procedures.

## Development Process

### 1. Code Generation

Each feature is developed following these steps:

1. AI generates code following:
   - Project structure
   - Dependency injection patterns
   - Type hints
   - Documentation requirements
   - Testing requirements

2. Code is generated adhering to:
   - black formatting rules (88 chars, double quotes)
   - isort import ordering
   - flake8 linting rules
   - Project's architectural patterns

### 2. Code Quality Checks

After each code generation:

1. Format Check & Fix:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   poetry run black src tests
   
   # Sort imports
   poetry run isort src tests
   
   # Lint code
   poetry run flake8 src tests
   ```

2. If issues are found:
   - AI reviews the errors
   - Regenerates code with fixes
   - Process repeats until clean

### 3. Testing

Tests are written and run at multiple levels:

1. Unit Tests (After each component):
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests for specific component
   poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_component.py -v
   ```

2. Integration Tests (After component integration):
   ```bash
   # Run integration tests
   poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v
   ```

3. Coverage Check:
   ```bash
   # Run tests with coverage
   poetry run pytest --cov=xrouter --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

### 4. Development Workflow

For each feature:

1. Initial Setup:
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/name
   
   # Install dependencies
   poetry install
   ```

2. Development Cycle:
   ```bash
   # 1. AI generates code
   
   # 2. Run quality checks
   poetry run black src tests
   poetry run isort src tests
   poetry run flake8 src tests
   
   # 3. Run tests
   poetry run pytest tests/unit/
   poetry run pytest tests/integration/
   
   # 4. Commit if all checks pass
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description"
   ```

3. Pre-commit Checks:
   ```bash
   # Run all checks before commit
   poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### 5. Quality Gates

Each code change must pass:

1. Style Requirements:
   - black formatting
   - isort import ordering
   - flake8 linting rules
   - Type hints present
   - Documentation present

2. Test Requirements:
   - Unit tests pass
   - Integration tests pass
   - Coverage >= 80%
   - No regressions

3. Documentation Requirements:
   - Docstrings for public APIs
   - Updated README if needed
   - Updated architecture docs if needed

## Tool Configuration

### black Configuration
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py311']
include = '\.pyi?$'
```

### isort Configuration
```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = true
line_length = 88
```

### flake8 Configuration
```ini
[flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = E203
exclude = .git,__pycache__,build,dist
```

### pytest Configuration
```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = ["test_*.py"]
addopts = "-v --cov=xrouter --cov-report=term-missing"
```

## Best Practices

1. Code Generation:
   - AI follows project patterns
   - Consistent style and structure
   - Clear documentation
   - Tests included

2. Testing:
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Test both success and error cases
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Check edge cases

3. Documentation:
   - Clear docstrings
   - Updated README
   - Architecture documentation
   - Comments for complex logic

4. Version Control:
   - Clear commit messages
   - Feature branches
   - Regular commits
   - Clean history

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions will run:
1. Code quality checks
2. Unit tests
3. Integration tests
4. Coverage report

## Error Handling

When quality checks fail:

1. AI analyzes errors:
   - Formatting issues
   - Linting problems
   - Test failures
   - Coverage gaps

2. AI proposes fixes:
   - Code improvements
   - Test additions
   - Documentation updates

3. Process repeats until all checks pass

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. Weekly:
   - Run full test suite
   - Check coverage
   - Update dependencies

2. Monthly:
   - Review documentation
   - Check for outdated patterns
   - Update tooling if needed
