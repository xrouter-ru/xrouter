Principles
OpenRouter helps developers source and optimize AI usage. We believe the future is multi-model and multi-provider.

How will you source your intelligence?

OpenRouter Provides
Price and Performance. OpenRouter scouts for the best prices, the lowest latencies, and the highest throughput across dozens of providers, and lets you choose how to prioritize them.

Standardized API. No need to change your code when switching between models or providers. You can even let users your choose and pay for their own.

Real-World Insights. Be the first to take advantage of new models. See real-world data of how often models are used for different purposes. Learn from your peers in our Discord channel.

Consolidated Billing. Simple and transparent billing, regardless of how many providers you use.

Higher Availability. Fallback providers, and automatic, smart routing means your requests still work even when providers go down.

Higher Rate Limits. OpenRouter works directly with providers to provide better rate limits and more throughput.
